Hi guys, my name is Braddy, I'm a third year UCDCS student and welcome to my talk. So today my talk is about what I did during my semester breaks and what I'd do differently. 

I've broken this short talk into four sections. So first off, what did I do?

I worked in SAP as an intern, and in Apache pizza as an assistant manager. Outside of that, I learned new languages and technologies, I researched a lot on study techniques and trying to find ways to maximize efficiency. I also did Leetcoding and a lot of personal development. Stuff like self confidence, maximizing productivity etc.

This sounds positive, but of course, there were serious issues. I had the wrong mindset trying to balance between full time jobs and self studying and learning new technologies

Firstly, I felt inadequate compared to my peers. I see people's github repo's and they have cool projects, they felt like coding wizards in class and I felt there was a need to constantly learn to improve myself

So my Udemy cart and to do list was quite extensive and I had a sense of urgency to complete these tasks. It became a vicious cycle where I was too tired to learn, I pushed myself but didn't get much productive work done, so then I'd get more bogged down and so on.

And the reason for the lists was that I believed the more tools I knew, the better developer I was and the more attractive I was to big companies. Don't get me wrong, it's certainly good to know a lot of these tools and they are specified on the job requirements but there was an associated issue.

That was the tools I need were somewhat extensive but my ability to produce good quality code and be a solid developer was not that great. And of course, this is a red flag since I do want to be a great software developer

Now I don't regret what I've learned since any kind of learning is fantastic and the stuff I learned did help. However I believe I could've been more efficient and utilized my semester break better

So what would I have done differently?

I would have ensured I got adequate rest, taken breaks and looked after my well being. I would've spent more time on Leetcode because I believe it's a great way to be proactive about your learning and yes, it's not representative of the problems to be solved at work, but it's a nice way to practice problem solving. And it'll really help in interviews. Lastly, I would've spent more time solidifying my software engineering fundamentals.

And so my point is striking a balance would have been way more beneficial than what I did

So my advice to my younger self is to strike a balance, and pace myself. I've got a whole lifetime to learn

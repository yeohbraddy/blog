In the age of where technology is present nearly everywhere, we are constantly engulfed in notifications, emails, messages, and tidbits that make our lives seem to advance rather quickly. In addition to that, we tend to spend a lot of time inside our heads where our minds is racing without the ability to slow down. Multiple thoughts challenging each other causing a pandamonium without you having control. Mindfulness empowers us to be aware in the present moment of our thoughts, feelings and environment. Being mindful enables us to allow thoughts and emotions to come and go freely. Instead of succumbing to the weightiness of the emotions, we allow it to flow unobstructedly, achieving a sense of harmony and eventually, peace. 

In the following, I will discuss how I try to be mindful.

**Asking 'why do I feel this way?'**

This allows us to hone in on our emotions, and perform a root cause analysis. This allows us to slow down our thoughts, take control, and address the anxiety building up. For example, you go to pay for your groceries, but your card is denied, and you see a queue of rather displeased people waiting for you and what seems like an unorganized shopping trip. You are embarrassed, thoughts rush in, and you feel flustered. You take a deep breath, and ask 'why do I feel this way?'. It could be you are ashamed as people may perceive it as a lack of money, or disorganization. 

When we hone in, we start to see our reaction is normal, and having these thoughts is normal and we know better of the situation that the people in the queue. This allows us to be more confident and present in the situation, taking control of our emotions allowing it to flow freely.

**Meditation**

Concentration (honing in on emotions) is the core of mindfulness. We may practice meditation to improve our concentration. I like to take a comfortable sitting position in a quiet place, and focus on my breathing. Inhale through the nose.. hold.. exhale through the mouth. During this time, I will acknowledge my emotions, accept everything on my mind as it is, and allow it to flow freely.  Random thoughts will float in, and you will notice having conversations with yourself, but this is normal as your concentration is settling in as your mind quietens.

**Patience**

Lastly, it's important to be patient with yourself and the practice of mindfulness. As mentioned at the start, we live in a frantic digital age where multi-tasking and productivity are bread and butter. The more we train ourselves to be mindful, the better we get, and eventually it becomes a powerful instantaneous tool we have at our disposal to achieve peace and happiness.

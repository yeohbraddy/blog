All views my own.

As a very quick introduction, I am currently on my second rotation as an intern in SAP. I am a SAP STAR intern which stands for "Student Training and Rotation" and not to be confused with the other internship, iXP, which is "Internship Experience" and is usually during 3rd year. During my first rotation, I went through the compulsory process of learning and studying SAP HANA, and then proceeding to work as a SAP HANA associate product support engineer. Furthermore, my manager was testing how the expansion of product support for interns to other areas of SAP would turn out at that time, and fortunately I got to work in SAP Fiori too. Currently I am working as a software engineer on the Augmented Analytics team, Smart Insights Service, which is primarily a backend team.

The following is what I think got me the internship, and may not necessarily be true. 

**Experiences and soft skills.**

*Seriously.*

I was expecting very technical questions like "Cracking the Coding Interview", but all I was asked in the realm of CS was what is an in-memory column database.

So, experience, and this may not necessarily be work experience. The reason I feel experience is important is because it allows you to demonstrate a multitude of your soft skills as the questions tend to revolve around situations that allow you to demonstrate your soft skills, and this is where experiences help a lot. So if you have had work experience or voluntary experience, great. If not, don't worry, there are still a lot of opportunities. Even something that happened in your personal life is worth sharing (I talked about my lack of believing in myself and my progress to change it). Use the STAR interview method and prepare some answers to potential questions. Usually the questions revolve around characteristics like problem solving (unhappy customer/team member, day gone wrong, etc.), showing independence and communication. Notice how these questions tend to include more than one characteristic. Finally, there is no incorrect answer as each interview will have their own bias and preference.

_As an example, I used to be an **assistant manager** (1) of an Irish pizza franchise that begins with A and has a red background as its logo. One day during my shift, someone jumped over the counter, grabbed a dinner knife and threatened a woman in her 30s who just started. I was in the back of the shop ~~on my phone~~ prepping toppings. I hear shouting so I go see what's up. Of course, the threatened lady is frightened, and attempts to run as she is cornered, but unfortunately gets slashed (no injuries, she was okay). **So I calmly go up to the guy to talk** (2), to which his demand was just free pizza. **The guy looked like he had been sleeping rough among other things, so I could understand.** I also knew this guy, and understood where he came from. **So I asked him politely to go back to the other side, I will not call the police (there was CCTV), and make him a free medium pizza (I still had a lot of dough since it was a quiet night) then went to chat about his wellbeing and praising his soccer abilities when we were younger.** After he received his pizza and left with haste, I went back to ~~my phone~~ prepping toppings. **I did check on the woman, made sure she was okay and then reported to the manager.**_

Okay, an analysis. The words in bold are the main points to discuss. 
- (1) Assistant manager tells me that more than likely I've had this job for some time and may have worked my way up, so I am looking for qualities that associate with that role. 
- (2) Taking initiative to control the situation like that is a green flag, and I am indirectly showing unbiased character by not being aggressive and not listening to him. Also demonstrates communication skills.
- (3) Awareness and understanding dynamic cultures. Extremely important in the workplace, especially when it's an international company.
- (4) Problem solving, adaptable and communication.
- (5) Teamwork

Also take note that I used the STAR method subtly in the example. The interviewer may not be analysing every single thing you say but the impression you give off will ultimately decide whether you nail the interview or not so do not be afraid of being descriptive.

Finally, do not disregard projects and practicing coding interview questions as at the end of the day, you are applying for a software engineering position at a tech company.
